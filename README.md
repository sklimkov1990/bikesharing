# Bike Sharing

## Overview
Analyze the New York City 'Citi Bike' trip data that has been released to the public for August 2019. Prepare a bike trip analysis for NYC, and use that analysis to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. However caution is needed when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York Cityâ€”Des Moines is quite different!
